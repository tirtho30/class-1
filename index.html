<h1>Sandwip and the collapse of Portuguese ambition</h1>
<i>By <b>Rila Mukherjee</b><br>
Last update on: Mon Jul 28, 2025<br></i>
<p>In his analysis of the Estado da India, which was the official name of the Portuguese Empire,
     George Winius distinguished between the formal administration by the Estado's headquarters
     at Goa over overseas possessions and the 'informal empire', which he called the 'shadow empire',
     that the Portuguese established in the Bay of Bengal. The shadow empire was a unique experiment 
     carried out by sailors, merchant adventurers, pirates, and missionaries, with little formal sanction
     either from Goa or from Portugal.</p>
<p>The general perception of this informal/shadow empire is that it was formed of renegades.
     But Sanjay Subrahmanyam saw many of the 'minor' settlements of the informal empire as commercially
     very dynamic. The informal empire was surprisingly successful in extending trade from the Bay
     of Bengal to Melaka, Macau, and beyond. The careers of Domingos Carvalho and Manuel de Matos,
     which we have already outlined, that of Filipe de Brito de Nicote, the subject of this article, 
     and the career of Sebastiao Goncalves y Tibau, which we will examine later, show that these settlements
     lay somewhere in between 'formal/informal' and 'major/minor'. Sandwip's distinctive position as a minor,
     disputed island sheds new light on Portuguese 'informal' expansion in the northern Bay of Bengal.</p>
<h3>Genesis of the Informal Empire</h3>
<p>During the viceroyalty of Lope Soares de Albergaria (1515-18), private Portuguese interests paralleled 
    official attention to the Bay. Men were allowed to leave official employment to seek their fortunes and
    conduct activities far from the reach of the Estado. Many thus left the Arabian Sea region, where Goa 
    was situated and which was the area of official Portuguese activity, and went over to the Bay of Bengal 
    region. Over time, others followed the same path after completing their service to the Portuguese crown,
    preferring to become rebels in relation to Portuguese authorities, or to settle in Asian territories 
    rather than return to Portugal.</p>

<p>Bengal was one such territory, with bands of Portuguese men and communities of Luso-Indians born of unions 
    with local women. Estimates from the end of the 16th and the middle of the 17th century suggest the presence
     of between 2,000 and 3,000 such people-merchants, pirates, and mercenaries in the service of local rulers.
     Jan Huygen van Linschoten saw these people as living "in a manner like wild men, and untamed horses, for that
     every man doth there what hee will, and every man is Lord," i.e., they were not subject to any law or political
     power. Portuguese words like almari, istri, ispat, chabi, balti, botam, janala, perek, alpin, toalia, etc., 
     entered the Bengali vocabulary at this time.</p>
<p>However, many of these renegade Portuguese maintained contact with official Portuguese representatives, and they
     had the possibility of reintegrating into Portuguese society through pardons granted by the Portuguese authorities.
     Distinguishing oneself in a trading or political capacity was a sure-fire path to a pardon. At the beginning of
     the 17th century, the Bengal-based Portuguese supplied information and services that were crucial for territorial
     conquest. This reveals the importance of communication channels that were maintained between the official
     and non-official realms. In 1602, Domingos Carvalho and Manuel de Matos tried to take advantage of this factor
     in their conquest of Sandwip. Situated close to Chittagong, this island was ideally located to attack the city
     and permit entry into southeast Bengal.</p>
<h3>The Coastal Dynamic</h3>
<p>At the centre of the Meghna estuary, Sandwip lay in a harsh and unforgiving land. Bengal's rivers are notorious for
     changing course almost overnight; this ensured that few had succeeded in controlling this hostile land. But this
     demanding coast, patterned by creeks and inlets through which rivers emptied into the sea, was a positive factor in
     Portuguese expansion. Other than the local rulers, the unofficial Portuguese, designated feringi, were the first to
     try to patrol this land's many waterways. Their informal empire was based on small islands and chars (sandbanks)
     in the marshy delta, with river channels providing the main means of communication. The many inlets and quick exit points
     through labyrinthine channels served as relay stations and stopovers to support plundering campaigns and provide supplies,
     as well as to permit ambushes.</p>
<p>The Portuguese operated with local support from bases in southeast Bengal, often as pirates but also hoping to participate
     in the local trade, including the slave trade. They benefited not only from the existence of the fluvial communication
     network, but also from an abundance of wood, which encouraged boat building. They profited from the numerous islands in
     the region, and tried at times to become de facto rulers of small, uninhabited but strategically located islands. The 
     distinctive topography thus dictated sailing patterns which were largely coastal in nature.</p>
<p>Bengal's dense fluvial network, resembling a high-tension spider's web,
     therefore saw intense navigation facilitating contact between the coast and the interior. Because the northern
     Bay was subject to vicious cyclones, river ports with sheltered harbours were the norm,
     rather than open sea ports. Such a location meant a robust, effective, and durable relationship with the hinterland.
     River ports could not be held separately from the political powers based in the interior. Some amount of negotiation
      with political authorities over the coast was inevitable. This would lead to friction, as we shall see.</p>
<i><b>"Despite lying in the most cyclone-prone area of Bangladesh, the growing Bay trade from the end of the 16th
     century—especially the salt trade—made Sandwip's maritime outlet an attractive trans-shipment hub for all.
     Even when the trade telescoped back into a coastal network, in 1838 some 500,000 maunds of salt were imported into
     the Dhaka region from Bhalwa, Sandwip, and Chittagong in no fewer than 160 sloops. Maghs and Chinese
     from Arakan's southeast coast engaged in this trade.</b></i>
<h3>Sandwip's Growing Importance</h3>
<p>Despite lying in the most cyclone-prone area of Bangladesh, the growing Bay trade from the end of the 16th century—especially
     the salt trade—made Sandwip's maritime outlet an attractive trans-shipment hub for all. Even when the trade telescoped back
     into a coastal network, in 1838 some 500,000 maunds of salt were imported into the Dhaka region from Bhalwa, Sandwip,
     and Chittagong in no fewer than 160 sloops. Maghs (ethnic Arakanese) and Chinese from Arakan's southeast coast engaged in this
     trade.</p>
<p>More than Chittagong, Sandwip was commercially important to Portugal at the end of the 16th century. Chittagong was frequently
     under Arakan's control, but Dianga—Chittagong's neighbouring port—was a notorious slave port with a small Portuguese
     settlement.</p>
<p>Portuguese-held Sandwip, functioning as a rival entrepôt (which Arakan destroyed only in 1617), was a key reason for
     Chittagong's slow development under Arakanese administration.</p>
<p>Historian Michael Charney identified Sandwip's commercial potential and strategic location as obstructing Chittagong's
     trade at this time, thereby making Sandwip significant to both Portugal and Arakan. Jesuit chronicler Fernão Guerreiro
     estimated that, at the beginning of the 17th century, Sandwip had 60 Portuguese trading ships, compared to 30 at Mrauk
     U—the inland port-capital of Arakan—and just ten at Chittagong.</p>
<P>What was the significance of Sandwip to Portugal at a time when its expansion in the Bay was faltering? In Philip's orders
     to the adventurer Filipe de Brito de Nicote dated 23 January 1607, Sandwip's importance to the Portuguese was clearly
     underlined: "And because the conquest of Pegu and the island of Sundiva has the importance that you know, I charge you
     dearly with doing for them everything in your power..." Also, the king needed funds to finance Portuguese expansion.
     Chittagong's treasure—which he referenced in a letter dated 20 February 1610—was considered worth taking.</P>
<p>De Brito's career illustrates the different roles that Dianga and Sandwip played in Portuguese designs: Dianga was a slave
     and pirate port, while Sandwip, under de Brito, was to be part of a grand scheme of official Estado expansion in the Bay,
     with Syriam as the centre and chief port.</p>
<p>However, in 1607, the Portuguese were driven out of Dianga, the most important settlement after Chittagong. To stem the decline,
     Philip II sought to end the casual nature of Portuguese settlements along the Bay. In a letter dated 26 March 1608, he stated
     his purpose: "…and how I considered it convenient to grant jurisdiction to Filippe de Brito, its captain [of Syriam], to
     reduce to my obedience the Portuguese that are in Bengal."</p>
<p>We have covered the first phase of Sandwip's unique history from 1590 until 1603; let us now examine its second phase.</p>

<h3>Sandwip 1603–07: Pivot between Lisbon, Syriam, Mrauk U</h3>
<p>The career of de Brito (Image 1) shows that Philip II of Portugal was contemplating an end to the informal empire in the Bay.
     De Brito, in service under Arakan's Min Razagyi from 1599, had by 1602 carved out a state for himself in the area stretching
     from the east of Chittagong, through a portion of Arakan, into Syriam (now known as Thanlyin), Lower Pegu, and Martaban. This
     made him an enemy of Arakan.</p>
<p>In 1602, Viceroy Saldanha married his niece to de Brito and appointed him commander of Syriam and general of the campaign
     for conquering Pegu. De Brito subsequently received the crown of Pegu 'in the name of the King of Spain and Portugal'. Sandwip,
     by virtue of its location, became crucial to de Brito's plans for expansion. Image 2 shows the places linked with de Brito's
     small empire and their proximity to Chittagong–Sandwip.</p>
<p>The Lower Burma ports traded with ports such as Sandwip via the coastal route. This route is shown in Image 3, which is a modern
     rendering of the coast as it was circa 1630. Because cyclones wreaked havoc on this coast, a safe haven like Sandwip was
     necessary</p>
<p>Of a storm on the Burma coast in 1566–67, the Italian traveller Cesare Federici wrote:</p>
<p>Wherefore in this Shippe we departed in the night, without making any provision of our water: and wee were in that Shippe fowr
     [four] hundreth and odde men: wee Departed from thence with Intention to goe to an I[s]land to take in water, but the windes
     were so contrary, that they woulde not suffer us to fetch it, so that by this meanes wee were two and forty Dayes in the Sea
     as it were lost, and we were driven too and fro…'.</p>
<p>De Brito was promised jurisdiction over Bengal in return for his undertaking to bring the Portuguese renegades living there back
     into the service of the Estado. In a letter to the king of Portugal, he suggested that he should seize control of southeast
     Bengal and build a fort at Chittagong, which would allow him to bring the Portuguese desperados under Goa's control. He became
     busy not only defending the new Portuguese possessions against neighbouring princes with force and diplomacy, but also in
     planning to expand the Portuguese empire in the Bay. His project envisaged making Syriam the main port of call in Burma, and
     Sandwip a subsidiary port to supplement Syriam's activities.</p>
<p>He insisted to the king of Portugal that Syriam be well fortified and provided with men and ships, with which he could force all
     navigation between India and Melaka to stop at Syriam and pass through the Custom House there, bringing huge benefits to the
     Portuguese treasury. To this effect, he requested the king to issue necessary orders to Portuguese merchants to call at Syriam;
     the rest of the ships he would force with the fleet at his disposal. He also patrolled the Bay to stop smuggling and thereby
     enrich his (and Portugal's) coffers.</p>
<p>To de Brito, the possession of a Portuguese enclave in the Bay was necessary for the Estado, not only because the monsoon system
     made it very convenient for shipping, but also because such a site was full of commercial advantages. But these plans were
     difficult to implement, and in 1605 de Brito faced a joint Arakan–Toungoo (Burmese) campaign to recapture Syriam. The campaign
     failed, but the wars against Arakan were taking their toll. Whether he could bring southeast Bengal under his control remained
     doubtful. In 1607, Arakan's Min Razagyi attacked Syriam again, but the siege was inconclusive and left de Brito still in
     control.</p>
<p>But his grand schemes ultimately failed. The Portuguese king eventually did not support de Brito's plans for the takeover of
     Sandwip. Nor did the Viceroy at Goa. De Brito never ruled over Sandwip.</p>
<p>Tragically, de Brito never received the support of Lisbon during his lifetime. Orders were sent by the king on 15 March 1613
     for all Portuguese ships trading in the Bay to stop at Syriam and pay taxes, but by the time the letter reached, the Burmese
     had killed de Brito in Syriam.</p>

<h3>Sandwip Abandoned</h3>
<p>De Brito and his schemes were not universally welcomed, and his plans for expansion into Bengal were challenged by the Portuguese
     at Dianga. In 1607, they advised the Arakan king against handing over Sandwip to him. Although the Dianga Portuguese were chased
     out by Arakan that same year, this complicated the plans for the Estado's acquisition of Sandwip. Manuel de Matos, sometime
     administrator of half of Sandwip's revenues and leader of the Dianga Portuguese, died at Dianga in 1607 when Arakan attacked
     the settlement. Fateh Khan, a Muslim officer of Pero Gomes—to whom Matos had entrusted Sandwip in his absence—now decided
     to take control of the island.</p>
<p>Gomes appears to have been a very poor administrator, since the king refers to him as a 'vile man of less substance than that of
     the conquistadores'. He told the Viceroy of India, Dom Francisco d'Almeida, that he should consider administering Sandwip
     directly if Matos continued to leave Gomes in a position of authority.</p>

<p>Usurping power from the unpopular Gomes, Fateh Khan had all 30 Portuguese traders on Sandwip, as well as their families, killed.
     All of the native Christians and their wives and children were also killed. Fateh Khan then raised a garrison of 'Moors' and
     Pathans and created his own fleet of 40 ships, which he maintained with the revenue from the prosperous island.</p>
<p>Fateh Khan felt he had a mission, and he displayed it prominently on his flag: 'Fateh Khan, by the grace of God, Lord of
     Sandwip, shedder of Christian blood and destroyer of the Portuguese nation'. In the same year, Min Razagyi made a pact
     with the Dutch to hand over Sandwip to them. Affairs at Sandwip were now in chaos. At this point entered Sebastião
     Gonçalves Tibau, a salt trader who had come to Sandwip. Sandwip now became the site for the career of this extraordinary
     adventurer—but one with far less talent than de Brito. This would form the third and final phase of Sandwip's unique history.</p>
